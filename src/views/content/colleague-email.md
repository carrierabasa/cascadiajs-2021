Hi {friend},

I just found out about a pretty awesome conference for web developers that I think you'd be interested in. It's called CascadiaJS, and they're running their event online this Nov 3-4.

[CascadiaJS](https://2021.cascadiajs.com) is the one of the best web & JavaScript conferences around. They've been running this conference since 2012 and the quality of the [speakers and talks](https://www.youtube.com/c/CascadiaJSConf/playlists) is really high. There are no "sponsored talks" and product pitches are not allowed. This year the talks will all be 20 minutes or less and the line-up looks really strong.

This year folks will have the option of attending online or at in-person hybrid events in Seattle, Portland and Vancouver BC. Each attendee is going to get a "Goodie Box" in the mail that will include a hoodie and other conference swag. The conference is packed with talks from 9am - 5pm that will cover everything from web components to GraphQL to the future of serverless and edge software deployments. They also have built in breaks and fun activities surrounding the event so that folks have a chance to meet each other, network and have fun. There are social events on both evenings that will include trivia, games and karaoke ðŸŽ¤.

In addition to the 2 day conference, there are several hands-on workshops being offered following the event, including [JavaScript, Node.js, ReactJS and GraphQL workshops](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/workshops). These workshops are limited to 50 seats each, so each workshop attendee will plenty of opportunities to ask question and interact with the instructors.

Anyway, I already bought my ticket, you should come! Hope you can join me!

Sincerely,

{you}
