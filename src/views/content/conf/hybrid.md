## Why is CascadiaJS "hybrid" this year?

Last year we did the hardest thing we've ever done: we took an in-person event that people love for its focus on people and relationships and we brought in online as a fully virtual event. We created an experience that stayed true to our roots, an event that put people first, connected folks, helped our community level-up and have tons of fun together! And what we lost in the form of high-fiving a friend, we gained in creating the biggest and most accessible CascadiaJS yet.

So how do we follow this up? With [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) of course! We are going to ship the awesome and accessible virtual event that people loved, and we're going to enhance it by adding Hybrid Events in Seattle, Portland and Vancouver BC. Folks who are comfortable gathering in person will be able to watch the live stream with fellow vaccinated attendees in their city, hang out and network during the breaks and socialize at evening events following Day One and Day Two. 

We will have more specific information about our COVID protocols shortly. All in-person attendees will be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination prior to entering any in-person events.

In this way, we hope that no matter who you are, where you are located or what your comfort level is with gathering around people, there is a way for you to attend CascadiaJS 2021 this year.
