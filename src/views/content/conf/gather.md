Gather is the platform we are using for face-to-face video chat in our Hallway Track. The link to join this virtual space is located on the [Dashboard](/home/dashboard).

Here's what you can expect:

- A fully digital space that you can walk around in, with the freedom to come and go as you please.
- The ability to chat in groups of up to 6 people based on proximity.
- "Private" tables with limited seating, for those personal 1:1 conversations.
- Common interest areas, including things like "React.js", "Portland, OR" and "Junior Devs"
- An Expo Hall where you can meet and greet our wonderful sponsors.
- A theatre where you can enjoy watching the Live Stream.
