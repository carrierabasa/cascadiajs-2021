## Digital Swag

We built some digital swag for you in the form of [Snap Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) lenses!

Anytime you're in an experience with your camera on (Remo, Karaoke, etc) you can switch your camera to Snap Camera and use one of these cool lenses.

## Watching the Talks

![Watching the live stream](/images/conf/watch-stream.png)

The live stream of talks will take place on here on our website.

### How do I show my appreciation at the end of the talk?

When we're physically together, everyone hears your clap in appreciation.

We've brought this experience online!

* Click on the Smiley Face widget in the bottom left corner of the window. The "Share how you feel!" dialog pops up.

* Click on any of the icons to show your appreciation. You (and all attendees) will hear your clap, and the widget keeps track of appreciations for that talk as well.

* To toggle the clapping audio on/off, see the `Clapping Audio` toggle in the top right of the window.

### Adjusting your view

To maximize the video window, you can hide the `Slack View` on the right of the video, or hide the `Captions` below the video. See the toggles in the top right of the window.

### How do I ask questions?

Ask a question in the Q&A widget on the left side of the window. Type your question, or up-vote an existing question.

### What are Talk Illustrations?

Each talk has an associated illustration created by [Mind's Eye Creative](https://www.mindseyecreative.ca).

### Can I easily view the talk schedule from the Live Stream page?

A copy of the schedule is below the Live Stream. It's a bit hidden due to auto-sizing of the page. Just use the vertical scrollbar to scroll down to the schedule.



## Chat powered by Discord

We have set-up a private Discord Server for folks to chat and share gifs in! The link to join this server is located on the [Dashboard](/home/dashboard).

Here are some channels you'll find:

- `#watercooler` - a place to meet others and hangout
- `#live` - chat about the talks as they happen
- `#help-questions` - get help from organizers
- `#workshop-courier` - meet folks from Courier & get help with the [Courier workshop](/workshops/courier)

## Trivia Night

Coming Soon!
