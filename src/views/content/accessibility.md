In order to build an inclusive community for web developers we work hard to make our event as accessible as possible. Below you'll find information on our efforts this year. If there's something you think we're missing, please don't hesitate to contact us. CascadiaJS is for everyone!

## This Website

The primary way to enjoy the conference in one this website. We will embed the following elements during the show:

- Live stream video/audio
- Live captions
- Q&A
- Reactions / clapping

If you see something we should fix, please let us know or [submit a PR](https://github.com/cascadiajs/cascadiajs-2021).

## Live Captioning

All of the talks, remarks and banter that take place during the live stream of the conference (9am - 5pm) will be live-captioned by [White Coat Captioning](https://www.whitecoatcaptioning.com/). This captioning will be embedded directly on the website and also made available at a separate URL.

## Hallway Track

We will be using two platforms to host our Hallway Track:

- Gather ([accessibility information](https://www.gather.town/accessibility-statement))
- Discord ([accessibility information](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500010454681-Accessibility-Settings-Tab))
