We are SO excited to announce the last two of our three venues for the hybrid events happening at CascadiaJS 2021: MoPop in Seattle and OMSI in Portland!

[MoPop](https://www.mopop.org/) is located in the Seattle Center, right near the Space Needle. It's easy to get to and very central so that our Opening and Closing After Parties will be walkable from the venue.

Likewise, [OMSI](https://omsi.edu/) is located just across the bridge from Downtown Portland. It's a gorgeous space and the perfect setting for reuniting with your fellow developers IRL.
