## Dapps Workshop

![Dapps workshop](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/social?path=/workshops/dapps)

As much of a buzz term as blockchain has become, it's still a great technology. To take some of the magic out of it, blockchain is essentially a distributed database. A blockchain is made of blocks that contain data and those blocks are chained together across multiple machines, which make up the distributed network. In this workshop, you'll build a distributed app in the Redwood framework that handles video data using a smart contract to handle blockchain interactions.

## Courier Workshop

![Courier Workshops](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/social?path=/workshops/courier)

Early stage startups can require building complex notification systems into their product to improve communication with users and increase user engagement, which can be a time consuming and expensive process.

This workshop demonstrates how you can use the Courier API to start sending notifications in seconds, across all channels. Learn how you can get started with sending 10,000 messages per month with the Free Tier.
