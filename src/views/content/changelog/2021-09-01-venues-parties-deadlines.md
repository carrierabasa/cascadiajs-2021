We are doing a **full buy out** of Voicebox Portland SE for our Portland Closing Party. We're excited to have the space completely to ourselves for 3 hours of fun and karaoke!

## Finally, a CascadiaJS Hack Event!

Leading up to CascadiaJS we are going to partner with Victoria, BC based [Battlesnake](https://www.battlesnake.com) to put on the first ever Battlesnake CascadiaJS Cup! We are limiting entries to **64 players** so stay tuned for your chance to register.

Players will learn how to code their Battlesnake using any stack or technology they like and then we will pit these 64 robo-snakes against each other in amazing tournament that will be live streamed on Twitch! The final four snakes will face-off against each other in a battle that will be streamed during CascadiaJS!
