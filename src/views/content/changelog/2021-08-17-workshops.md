Every year, we work with some of the best folks in the industry to put on workshops that build on the topic covered at CascadiaJS. This year we are thrilled to have 4 amazing people putting on 9 workshops over the course 5 days following CascadiaJS. An event of this magnitude deserves a name, so `<say>hello</say>` to Workshop Week!

See below for more information about our wonderful instructors. You can also check out the [full list of workshops](/workshops) which run from Monday, Nov 8 to Friday, Nov 12. 

Oh, and when you bundle a workshop ticket with a conference ticket you save **$50 per half-day workshop** and **$100 per full-day workshop**. So if you register for a few workshops, you can pretty much attend CascadiaJS for free üòé
