## Hoodie Fit Guide and Goodie Box deadline

We have published a [Hoodie Fit Guide](/hoodie-fit-guide) to make sure that everyone gets the right hoodie for them.

Ordering your hoodie is a step that comes *after* you purchase your ticket. Here's the rought flow:

- Purchase your ticket
- Visit our [Next Steps](/next-steps) webpage
- Log-in using your unique Ticket Reference ID
- Click the button to "Redeem Your Goodie Box"

You MUST complete this step prior to <span class="highlight warning">Sept 17</span> in order to get your hoodie produced and shipped in time for the conference.
