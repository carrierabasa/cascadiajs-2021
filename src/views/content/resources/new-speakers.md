# ¬†üì£ 5 Tips To Get You Started On Your Talk  

- **Forget about your presentation software. Outlines are your friend.** Start with a simple notes application and pretend like you are just speaking through your talk. What do you want to say, what examples do you want to point to, run through them. This will help you work through what you want to talk about and once you have that written out, share with your network, with us, and we‚Äôll work through it.
- **Iterate on your outline.** Once you have an outline, work with it a bit before transferring over to slides. Run through the talk in your head or with a friend (or a Cascadia speaker resource!) and see what sections make sense and what you may need to add. When trying 
- **Use presentation software you are comfortable with.** Everyone has opinions on what the best way is to present, but ultimately, it‚Äôs up to you and what you feel good about. You can start with a simple Keynote or Powerpoint presentation, and add to it. Use tools like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for templates and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for images (be sure to give credit).
- **Rehearsal is key.** Even doing this reading out loud to yourself is helpful. Make sure you are comfortable with your message and how you want things to come across. 
- **Demos are great when executed correctly.** It can be easy to do live coding or a demo to fill space in your talk, however this can be dangerous for where things go wrong. When walking through a technical example here are some tips:
  - Put each section into a different branch or commit. You can then traverse your changes without ‚Äúlive‚Äù coding but while showing progress or changes. This can allow you to speak to those changes without typos or messing things up as much.
  - Break sections into small snippets of code.  You don‚Äôt have to have the entire file shown to make your point. Highlight key functions and the what and why they are important. You can even [create your own snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) in something like [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devonray.snippet) and bind them to shortcuts
