Here are some resources for recording your talk for CascadiaJS 2021. We hope you find this helpful. Let us know if you have any tips or tricks, and we'll update this guide. [PRs are welcome](https://github.com/cascadiajs/cascadiajs-2021/tree/main/src/views/content/resources)!

## Choose a Recording Tool

We are strongly encouraging all speakers to use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record their talks. It has most every feature folks would need and we can best provide support for you if you use this tool.

However, the choice is yours. So long as you record a video that meets our requirements, you may use any combination of tools that you like.

## Downloading Loom

We have purchased a business license and we are happy to add all of you to our Workspace so that you have access to all of the pro features of Loom for free!

# Setting up your environment

- Use something like [BetterSnap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12) to create a good space on your screen
- Move your windows right below your camera so it’s natural looking at the person

# General Recording Tips

- Record your video in 720P resolution (1280x720). Some slideshow tools like Powerpoint will allow you to force your presentation to this resolution. 
- BetterSnap can snap windows to specific resolutions too!
- Try to have a change on screen happen every 30 seconds or so. This helps keep the viewer engaged. Examples:
- - Have bullets in slides appear one at a time
- - Have an arrow appear and point at the line of code you are talking about
- - Gifs of functionality or demos
- Use callouts (e.g. arrows, boxes, etc) to draw the viewers eyes to what you want them to be paying attention to
- If you’re trying to communicate a complicated idea, write a little script for yourself that explains it exactly the way you want. Nobody will know you’re reading a couple pre-written paragraphs :)
