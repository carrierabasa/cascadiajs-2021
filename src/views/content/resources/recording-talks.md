# Setting up your environment

- Use something like [BetterSnap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12) to create a good space on your screen
- Move your windows right below your camera so it’s natural looking at the person

# General Recording Tips

- Record your video in 720P resolution (1280x720). Some slideshow tools like Powerpoint will allow you to force your presentation to this resolution. 
- BetterSnap can snap windows to specific resolutions too!
- Try to have a change on screen happen every 30 seconds or so. This helps keep the viewer engaged. Examples:
- - Have bullets in slides appear one at a time
- - Have an arrow appear and point at the line of code you are talking about
- - Gifs of functionality or demos
- Use callouts (e.g. arrows, boxes, etc) to draw the viewers eyes to what you want them to be paying attention to
- If you’re trying to communicate a complicated idea, write a little script for yourself that explains it exactly the way you want. Nobody will know you’re reading a couple pre-written paragraphs :)
