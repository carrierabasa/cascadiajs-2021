## Monitoring COVID-19

The CascadiaJS organizers are currently monitoring the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) situation carefully and daily to ensure the safety of our attendees, speakers, and staff With this mind, we plan on updating this page on a regular basis.

## General Safety Precautions in All Locations

To ensure safety, we plan on taking the following health precautions:

- Vaccination card or passport required for entry into the conference events.
- Masks will be provided for all attendees.
- We will work with a health coordinator to ensure all health precautions are followed. 
- We will have hand sanitizer stationed at the entrance, food stations, rooms and various locations throughout the conference.
- We will regularly sanitize all surfaces throughout the event space and communicate with the venue to do the same.

**Local COVID-19 Guidelines**

Local COVID-19 guidelines may change as we get closer to the conference. We will rigorously enforce ALL local guidelines, including possible indoor or outdoor mask recommendations. We will update this page with guidelines specific to [Seattle](#seattle-wa), [Portland](#portland-or) and [Vancouver, BC](#vancouver-bc) as we learn more. 

**What We Ask of Attendees**

We will ask that anyone planning to attend who is feeling under the weather, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath, to refrain from joining us this year for the safety of other attendees.

We may revise the CascadiaJS COVID Procedures in order to remain in compliance with CDC guidelines and in response to community transmission and variants at the time of the conference.  You agree to regularly check this page to monitor and be prepared to comply with any such changes.
