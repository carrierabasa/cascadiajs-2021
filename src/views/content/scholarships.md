CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the JavaScript community in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive, so we're excited to work with our community to fund this year's Opportunity Scholarship Program.

## Requirements

The Opportunity Scholarship Program is open to everyone who is able to attend both days of the conference and meet *one* of the following requirements:

- Is a member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech
- Has financial constraints that make purchasing a ticket a blocker to attending

## How it works

- Apply for a scholarship
- If you meet the requirements, you will be offered a Scholarship Ticket at the discounted rate of $29
- If you cannot afford this ticket, that's ok! You can request Financial Aid and we'll be in touch

## Attending In-Person

- If you would like to attend an in-person hybrid event, select which one when filling out the form
- Depending on capacity, we will reach out to Scholarship Recipients about upgrading their tickets to in-person

## Please help us spread the word!

Please help us in our outreach efforts. Take a moment to share this Scholarship Application with relevant people or organizations. We hope this Scholarship Program can enable you to join us and contribute to our community!
