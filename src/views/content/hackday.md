Leading up to CascadiaJS we are going to partner with Victoria, BC based [Battlesnake](https://www.battlesnake.com) to put on the first ever Battlesnake CascadiaJS Cup! We are limiting entries to **64 players**.

Battlesnake is a multi-player programming game based on the classic game 'Snake'. You design, build, and deploy a live web server that responds to the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api). Each Battlesnake is controlled autonomously by a live web server and moves independently attempting to find food, avoid other Battlesnakes, and stay alive as long as possible.

## No prior experience required!

Participants should have a base-level comfort writing code in at least one programming language. Starter project templates, free hosting options, and a tutorial session are all provided! Winners will receive giftcards to the [Battlesnake Merch Store](https://store.battlesnake.com/)!

Battlesnake is a *fun and accessible way for anyone to become a better programmer*. Use Battlesnake to learn new technologies, improve your programing skills, and have fun with friends, family, and colleagues.

Attendees will learn how to code their Battlesnake using any stack or technology they like and then we will pit these 64 robo-snakes against each other in amazing tournament that will be live streamed on Twitch! The final four snakes will face-off against each other in a battle that will be streamed during CascadiaJS!
