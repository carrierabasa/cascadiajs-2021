There are many inaccessible websites in the world today. As web creators, we can make incredible strides toward better access by learning about digital accessibility and applying it in our work. In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of accessibility for the Web Platform using semantic [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). 

Part one will cover how to plumb accessibility information through pages and web apps for assistive technologies using semantic HTML and responsible ARIA. You'll learn manual testing tools and processes to check your work along the way. You'll also learn how CSS impacts page semantics and the accessibility tree, starting to grow your web accessibility knowledge.

In part two, you'll learn the basics of accessible interactivity on the web with JavaScript events. We'll cover how to respond to user input for a variety of interactions, such as keyboard and mouse clicks, as well as the mechanics involved for assistive technologies like screen readers. Lastly, you'll apply the basics of accessibility for the Web Platform when learning about specific characteristics of accessibility in JavaScript web applications.

This workshop is intended as a beginner to intermediate technical workshop. Some experience with JavaScript coding will be helpful, but not required, as there will be opportunities to test live websites for accessibility without any coding.
