Go beyond the basics of Node.js in this fast-paced workshop that will teach you how to handle asynchronous data and data streaming in Node. We’ll start by reviewing common async patterns like callbacks, promises, and async/await to manage processes and enforce sequential, parallel, and concurrent execution. We’ll then work with different types of streams to ensure that execution is as fast as possible. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a new set of skills for building advanced, enterprise-scale applications with Node.js.
