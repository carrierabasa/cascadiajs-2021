As much of a buzz term as blockchain has become, it's still a great technology. To take some of the magic out of it, blockchain is essentially a distributed database. A blockchain is made of blocks that contain data and those blocks are chained together across multiple machines, which make up the distributed network.

In this workshop, we'll build a distributed app in the Redwood framework that handles video data. We'll make a smart contract to handle our blockchain interactions. Then we'll set up the Redwood distributed app that will work with the blockchain.

## Key Takeaways

- How to write smart contracts in Solidity
- How to build a distributed app with Redwood
- How to deploy smart contracts to the Ethereum network
