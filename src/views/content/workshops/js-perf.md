We all want blazing fast applications; our users demand fast, our product teams design for fast, our management needs fast, and we constantly push for fast. But, do you ever feel overwhelmed by these demands and how to _really_ build fast browser-based apps?

In this 1-day hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to analyze, measure, monitor, and build fast apps that will drive growth and engagement. How? We’ll start by learning the basics of what makes an app fast. Then, we’ll take a deep dive into the DevTools provided in Google Chrome. Knowing how to measure and analyze the runtime performance of your application is the secret key to building blazing-fast apps, and Chrome DevTools provides all of the tools you need.

In this workshop you’ll learn:

- How to measure runtime performance
- How to read and analyze flame charts
- How to analyze frame per second
- How to use the rendering tools
- How to use the layers panel
- How to identify bottlenecks using the call tree and bottom-up tools
- How to identify memory leaks
- How to identify the number of visible and hidden DOM elements
- How to identify costly event listeners
- How to find unused JavaScript and CSS using the coverage tools
