## About this Workshop

Imagine owning a sports car but never making it into top gear. Thatâ€™s a little like using the strongly typed GraphQL without a strongly typed front-end language. This workshop will give you the background you need to get the best of both worlds without the headache and second-guessing. This will be a 3 hour workshop with plenty of time to code along and ask any questions.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with React
- Visual Studio Code

## Key Takeaways

- The basics of relational data
- Designing a set of basic data models for our exercise
- Scaffolding a GraphQL API to interact with our data
- Using tools to generate a type-safe SDK for the API
- Building a small Next.js app using our generated SDK to communicate with our GQL service & database
- Integrating the typed SDK with Apollo Client
- JWT auth, and integrating it with Apollo Client
- Deploying the frontend to Vercel
