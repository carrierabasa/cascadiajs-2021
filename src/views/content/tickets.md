## Ticket Options

When you buy a ticket to CascadiaJS 2021, you have the option of purchasing a ticket to the virtual event (modeled after last year's fully virtual conference, [which was awesome](#highlights-from-cascadiajs-2020)) or a ticket to an in-person Watch Party in Seattle, Portland or Vancouver, BC.

No matter what ticket you purchase, you will have the option of adding one or more [workshops](/workshops) to your order, which will all take place the week after the conference. When you purchase a workshop ticket bundled with a conference ticket, you save $50 for half-day workshops and $100 for full-day workshops.
