## Ticket Options

When you buy a ticket to CascadiaJS 2021, you have the option of purchasing a ticket to:

- The virtual event (modeled after last year's fully virtual conference, [which was awesome](#highlights-from-cascadiajs-2020)) 
- An in-person hybrid event in Seattle, Portland or Vancouver, BC

No matter what ticket you purchase, you will have the option of adding one or more [workshops](/workshops) to your order, which will all take place the week after the conference. When you purchase a workshop ticket bundled with a conference ticket, you save <span class="highlight warning">$50</span> for half-day workshops and <span class="highlight warning">$100</span> for full-day workshops.

Finally, you'll have the option of helping us fund our Scholarship Program. Last year we raised over $2,000 from our community, and we hope to do even better this year!
