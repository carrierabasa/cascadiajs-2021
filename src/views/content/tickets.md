<i class="fas fa-gifts"></i> Goodie Box with a [hoodie](/hoodie-fit-guide), stickers and other fun stuff **shipped to you**

## Hybrid In-Person Events

## Buying a Conference Ticket

When you purchase a ticket, you will have the option of adding one or more [workshops](/workshops) to your order, which will all take place the week after the conference. When you purchase a workshop ticket bundled with a conference ticket, you save <span class="highlight warning">$50</span> for half-day workshops and <span class="highlight warning">$100</span> for full-day workshops.

You'll also have the option of helping us fund our Scholarship Program. Last year we raised over $2,000 from our community, and we hope to do even better this year!

Following the conference, we have organized a week of awesome workshops being run by industry experts covering everything from Node.js to Accessibility to React!

## Applying for a Scholarship

The Opportunity Scholarship Program is open to everyone who is able to attend both days of the conference and meet *one* of the following requirements:

- Is a member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech
- Has financial constraints that make purchasing a ticket a blocker to attending
